Virtual Network Gateway (VNG)
Connects VNet to on-premises networks or other VNets
Subnets
Divide VNet into smaller, manageable sections
Network Security Groups (NSGs)
Control inbound/outbound traffic
Network Interfaces (NICs)
Connect VMs to VNet
Route Tables
Define traffic routing rules
Azure Load Balancer
Distributes traffic across resources
Application Gateway
Web traffic management
Connectivity
Internet
Public access
On-premises network
Site-to-site VPN
Other VNets
VNet peering
